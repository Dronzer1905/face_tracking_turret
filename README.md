the python file contains the OpenCV code for the face detection
the .py file then sends the centre coordinates of the face to the arduino using serial communication
there fore make sure the right COM port is mentioned in the .py file and also that no other read or write process is going on in the serial port
flash the the arduino with the .ino code
close the serial monitor (if open)
run the python script
